======================
The variables included in this dataset are a subset of the data obtained for the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
======================
These data were gathered as follows:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
=====================
The following files are included:

-Codebook_runanalysis.txt: 

- README.txt: outlines the data processing steps

-run_analysis.R:  this is the script that includes all the data manipulation steps necessary to reproduce the dataset

tidy_run_data.txt: contains the processed tidy data with mean measures for each activity for each subject

======================================= 
Variables in the dataset tidydata.txt:



- [1]“activity"   : indicates the activity the subject was engaged in when the measure was obtained

	values: 1=Walking; 2=Walking Upstairs; 3=Walking Downstairs; 4=Sitting; 5=Standing; 6=Laying
      
 -[2]“subject"    : this indicates the subject who carried out the activity; there were 30 total subjects, ID=1:30

- The measures contained in variables 4-88 represent the average of each measure grouped by activity for each subject in the dataset:
